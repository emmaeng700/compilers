Learning Onjectives
    1. Learn anout abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and how program can represent and
       manipulate other programs. Good for working with linters, static analyzers,
       and meta-programming
    2. Learn(revise) assembly, calling conventions, and low level details of computer

Integers
   gcc return_2.c : compile source file
   gcc -o return_2 return_2.c
   ./return_2

   convert to assembly(AT&T syntax)
   gcc -S -O3 -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables return_2.c
   cat return_2.s

   .global _main indicates that the _main symbol should be visible to the linker, otherwise
   it can't find the entry point to th program

   using a python script (regular expression) to extract the return value
   from the source code => (python3 main.py return_2.c)

   parsing the whole program with one big reg expression isn't a viable long term strategy
